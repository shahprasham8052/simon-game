    <h1>SIMON GAME</h1>
    <h2>The Simon game is a classic electronic memory game, where players need to repeat a sequence of colored buttons.
        Here are the rules:</h2>
    <div class="rules">
        <h3>
            <ol>

                <li>The game starts when the player presses the "Start" button.</li>

                <li>Simon (the game) will light up one of the four colored buttons (red, blue, green, or yellow) and
                    emit a
                    sound.</li>

                <li>The player must repeat the sequence of the lit buttons by pressing them in the same order. For
                    example,
                    if Simon lights up red, the player should press the red button, and if Simon then lights up blue,
                    the
                    player should press red, then blue.</li>

                <li>If the player correctly repeats the sequence, Simon will add another button to the sequence and
                    repeat
                    the process. The game continues with Simon adding one button to the sequence each time.</li>

                <li>If the player makes a mistake and presses the wrong button, the game is over, and the player must
                    start
                    again from the beginning.</li>

                <li>The game continues until the player has correctly repeated a sequence of 20 buttons, at which point
                    they
                    have won the game.</li>

                <li>The game also has a "strict" mode, where making a mistake results in the player starting from the
                    beginning again, regardless of how far they have progressed.</li>

            </ol>
